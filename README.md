This is my first solo project without using any exterior help.

It is Hangman. It picks a random word from an array and displays the hidden word and the nubmer of letters. You get to guess the letters and if the guess is correct the letter is revealed. Guess all the letters and hangman goes free.

It is only playable using Python. It was entirely developed in the Python programming language.

This was a test of my skills and produced so that my 70 year old father could use it.

This work was completed May 15, 2018.

I still need to enable it to be run as a separate application so you don't need Python to run it.
