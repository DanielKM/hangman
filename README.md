What does it do? 
This is my first solo project without using any exterior help.

It is Hangman. It picks a random word from an array and displays the hidden word and the nubmer of letters. You get to guess the letters and if the guess is correct the letter is revealed. Guess all the letters and hangman goes free.

What technologies are used?
It is only playable using Python. It was entirely developed in the Python programming language.

What is the ambition of the project? 
This was a test of my skills and produced so that my 70 year old father could use it.

What is the stage of the project?
This work was completed May 15, 2018.

Are there some known issues or things that are not properly done?
I still need to enable it to be run as a separate application so you don't need Python to run it.
